# Secret-Weapon
Passion Project for secret weapon, an app designed around connecting trade experts with hobbyists in need of help.


Overview:
For any person whose ever tried to do their own house project, whether it's replacing a fill valve in a toilet tank, building a new set of stairs for their deck, or maybe installing some new speakers in their car. Everyone runs into unexpected issues, and youtube videos can never account for exactly where you're having a problem, but the experts can. Secret Weapon is designed to be a way to connect a hobbyist-type user who is experiencing a roadblock in their project, with an expert-level consultant. The user will enter specific details of their project issue, and the expert will be able to respond. If it requires more than a text response, the user and expert can connect for a short 5-10 minute zoom style call wherein the expert can guide the hobbyist to overcoming their blocker. 

How the app will work:
The User side will feature a scroll wheel of trades that they can explore help with, as well as a drop down menu for existing help requests, previously solved help requests, or a selector for creating a new help request. 

The Expert side will feature a feed of presented problems that apply to the expert's area of expertise. So a plumber will have a feed full of problems submitted for plumbers that they can choose to respond to and help with, but they will not see a carpenter's feed and vice versa. This will keep the focus for the expert by only showing categories applicable to them.
